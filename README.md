# FacialSyc
final project

Android application could compute users' facial expression synchronization
For exchanging facial information data, you should use our account: username: yaleishi@gmail.com / password: 1234567890 and username: perrysong@gmail.com / password: 1234567890 to test facial synchronization level.
Two devices should sign in at the same time, and the synchronization value will be more accurate in the latest sign in the device.
After sign in, both devices should be able to detect a face in front cameras. Otherwise, the app will fail to compute the facial synchrony level.
To use our app, you should also include a google-services.json file in your android studio's app directory. The file I have submitted in canvas.
Enjoy our Facial synchronization app! Cheers!
